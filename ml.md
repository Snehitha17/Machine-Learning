# What is Machine Learning?

**Machine learning is the ability for computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed**.

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

# How does Machine learning works?

Machine learning is looking at large sets of past data  and divide the useful model to predict things from past behavior to future.
- First we provide the dataset to the system i.e we provide the input data.
-	The system goes through the entire dataset or analyzes it to find patterns based on size, shapes, colors, etc.
- Now that it has figured out the patterns, the systems takes decisions and starts separating the photos based on the patterns.
- Once the work is done, the system learns from the feedback it gets. If it gets any of wrong  output, it will make sure it does not happen in the future.

So, that’s essentially how Machine Learning works, it analyzes the input data, looks for patterns in it and then takes decision based on the patterns and finally learns from the feedback it gets.

# Categories of Machine learning?
**Machine learning is subcategorized into 3 types**:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

# Supervised Learning :-
Machine learning method where each instances of a training data set is composed of different input attributes and an expected output. The input attribute of a training dataset can be of any kind of data. For each input instance an expected output values are associated values can be discrete representing a category or can be real or continous value in either case the algorithm learns the input pattern that generates expected output.

**Examples of Supervised Learning** :

you get bunch of photos with informaton what is on them and you train a model to recognize new photos.
you have bunch of molecules and information which are drugs and you train a model to answer whether new molecule is also a drug.

Popular supervised learning algorithms are Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines.

# Unsupervised learning :-

Machine learning method where we only have input data and no corresponding output variable associated to them instead detects pattern based on charasteristics of input data. The instances are grouped together in order to identify clusters of data.

**Examples of Unsupervised Learning** :

you have bunch of photos of 6 people but without information who is on which one and want to divide this dataset into 6 piles, each with photos of one individual.
you have molecules, part of them are drugs and part are not but you do not know which are which and you want algorithm to discover the drugs.

Popular unsupervised learning algorithms are Apriori Algorithm, K-Means Algorithm, Hierachial Clustering.

# Reinforcement Learning :-
It is a machine learning which allows software and machines to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context to maximize its performance.

Reinforcement learning is about interaction between two elements the environment and the learning agent. The learning agent leverages 2 mechanisms namely exploration and exploitation.

When learning agent acts on trail and error it is termed Exploration.
When it acts on knowledge based on environment it is referred to as Exploitation.

The machine is trained using reinforcement learning if it makes correct decision it gets reward points otherwise for wrong decision it receives penalty.

# What are the applications of Machine Learning?

**Most common applications of machine learning these days**:-

1.**Google Search**:
The Machine Learning algorithm goes through your previous search data to give you the best search results on google. So, if you searched for an actor like Robert Downy Junior on google, it will also take you to pages on Iron Man, or other movies he has worked on.

2.**Stock Predictions**:
Machine Learning algorithms are used to analyze old stock data and predict the future values.
 
3.**Robotics**:
 Machine learning is widely used in the field of robotics. Recently there was a robot named ‘Sophia’ introduced which could actually behave like humans.

There are many applications in various fields like Banking, Retail, Medical etc.

# Supervised Learning Algorithm Applications
**Temperature:-**
         Predicting temperature for a given time whenever sunny              temperature is high, whenever it is cloudy then humidity should be high.
         
**Biometric Attendance:-**
         Where we train the machine and after couple of inputs of biometric identity like thumb impression, earlobe, iris once trained. The machinecan validate future input.
         
**Banking Sector:-**
         For predicting credt worthiness of a credit card holder by building machine learning model to look after faulty attributes by providing it with deliquent and non-deliquent customers.  

**HealthCare Sector:-**
      It is used to predict patient's readmission rates by building a regression model by providing data on patients treatment adminitration and readmissions to variables that best correlate with readmission. 

**Retail Sector:-**
      For analyzing the product that customer buy together does this by building a supervised model to identify frequent items and association rules from the transcational data.

# Unsupervised Learning Algorithm Applications

**Banking Sector:-**
       In Banking sector it is used to segment customers by behavioral characteristics by surveying prospects and customers to develop multiple segments using clustering.
       
**HealthCare Sector:-**
      It is used to characterise the MRI data using normal or abnormal images. It uses deep learning techniques to build a model that learns from different features of images to recognize a different pattern.

**Retail Sector:-**
It is used to recommend the products based on their past purchases. It does this by building a collabrative filltering based on the past purchases.

# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Applications
 
 **Banking Sector:-**
    It is used to create a next best offer model for a call center by building a predictive model that learns over  time as user accept or reject offer made by sales staff.
    
**HealthCare Sector:-**
     It is usedto allocate the scarce medical resoources to handle different type of er cases by building a mark of decision process that learns treatment strategies for each type of er case.
     
**Retail Sector:-**
It can be used to reduce excess stock by building a dynamic pricing model based on the customer response on offers.

# Advanages and Disadvantages of Machine Learning?

**Advantages of Machine Learning :-**

i. Sensor data analysis: Nowadays machine learning is used to discover relevant features in otherwise disordered datasets. Such features can be useful for things such as face detection, face recognition, speech recognition or image classification.

ii.	Data Handling: Machine learning is used to handle multi-dimensional and multi-variety data in dynamic environments.

iii.	Time Reduction: Machine learning allows time cycle reduction and efficient utilization of resources.

iv. Machine learning helps to improve based on the past experience. Wondering? Machine learning algorithms function as agents to improve on continuous basis based on historical data.

**Disadvantages of Machine learning:-**

i.	**Works with continuous loss functions**: Non-differentiable discontinuous loss functions are hard to optimize using machine learning techniques. There are several reasons why discontinuous loss functions are important. In cases such as sparse representations, discontinuous loss functions can help to find such sparse representations. In many cases such non-differentiable loss functions are approximated by smooth loss functions without much loss in sparsity.

ii.	**Large data requirements**: Some machine learning algorithms need a lot of training data such as deep learning algorithms. It might be cumbersome to work with or collect such large amounts of data. Fortunately there are a lot of training data for image recognition purposes.

iii.	**Accuracy**: Interpretation of results is also a major challenge to determine effectiveness of machine learning algorithms.

iv. Acquisition of relevant data is the major challenge. Based on different algorithms data need to be processed before providing as input to respective algorithms. This has significant impact on results to be achieved or obtained.

Machine Learning is a subset of artifical Intelligence . It focuses on the desiging of systems, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experiences which is data in case of machine. ML enables computer to act and make data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed to carry out certain task these programs are designed to learn and improve overtime when exposed to new data.
